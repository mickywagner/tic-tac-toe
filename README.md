<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This project was part of the Fullstack Javascript track, Javascript course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>. The assignment was to create a 2 player tic-tac-toe game, implementing the logic and UI to track wins, show who had the next move, clear the board, and showcase the winnter. The idea was to use common Javascript design patterns like factory functions and modules.</p>
